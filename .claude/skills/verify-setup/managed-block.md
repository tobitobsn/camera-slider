## AI Engineering Workflow

This project uses the AI Engineering Kit — a spec-driven workflow. Development runs in phases, each driven by a skill:

`/init → /write-spec → /architecture → /tasks → /build → /qa → /deploy`   (`/refine` & `/audit` anytime · `/dsgvo` when personal data is involved · `/e2e-tests` for critical flows · `/security-check` & `/cleanup` after `/deploy`)

- **Feature specs** live in `features/{{FEATURE_PREFIX}}-X-name/`: `spec.md` (the contract — WHAT), `design.md` (the technical design — HOW), `tasks.md` (the ordered build plan), `qa-report.md` (the test report).
- **Acceptance Criteria** carry stable IDs (`AC-1`, `AC-2`, …). The chain is **AC → Task → Test**.
- **Project status** is tracked in `features/INDEX.md`.
- `spec.md` is **read-only during `/build`** — it is the stable contract.
- **One working language** for the whole project — the conversation *and* every document the skills write, acceptance criteria included. It is recorded under Key Conventions below.
